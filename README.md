# Research Scripts

This repository contains code and notebooks for ongoing research on **regime-aware portfolio management**.

## Focus Areas
- **Regime Changes in Risk Parity (RP):**  
  Studying how macroeconomic and financial market regimes affect the allocation and performance of risk parity portfolios.  
- **Volatility & Correlation Dynamics:**  
  Using Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and related approaches to estimate regime-dependent volatilities and correlations.  
- **Overlay Strategies:**  
  Exploring robust optimization, factor timing, and risk overlays to enhance diversification during turbulent periods.  

## Repository Structure
- ðŸ“‚ `01. Code/` â†’ Jupyter notebooks with data pulls, simulations, and strategy analysis  
- ðŸ“‚ `02. Data/` â†’ Local storage for intermediate data exports (not synced to GitHub)  

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository  
2. Open notebooks in **JupyterLab** or **Jupyter Notebook**  
3. Run scripts step by step to replicate data downloads and portfolio construction
